# GSoC 2025 - Integrating Agents.jl with Reinforcement Learning Techniques
## Google Summer of Code 2025

The project took place over the summer of 2025 as part of the Google Summer of Code program. The aim was to improve the library Agents.jl, the most popular and best performing library for developing agent based models in julia, adding the possibility to let the agents learn how to behave using reinforcement learning.
