# GSoC 2025 - Integrating Agents.jl with Reinforcement Learning Techniques
## Google Summer of Code 2025

The project took place over the summer of 2025 as part of the Google Summer of Code program. The aim was to improve the library Agents.jl, the most popular and best performing library for developing agent based models in julia, adding the possibility to let the agents learn how to behave using reinforcement learning. The idea had already been suggested in an issue opened in 2022 (https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl/issues/648). Indeed, as described in the issue for a casual user of the liibrary it was not easy to understand how to take advantage of the functionalities of Agents.jl and do reinforcement learning on the agents too.
